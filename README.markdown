# mvcc

This repo contains sample code for my talk on using the Model-View-Controller 
Pattern with a Coordinator.

## Branches

The `master` branch has the 'old,' simplistic way of implementing the app. It results
in a Monolithic View Controller, and is difficult to test

The code in the `mvcc` branch uses the Coordinator object. The tests run 4300 times
faster, and in-process.
